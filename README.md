# AIRNEIS

Ã€IRNEIS ("furniture" in Scottish Gaelic) is a Scottish company, and we sell furniture designed by Scottish designers.
Until now, we've sold products by mail order or via partner stores, but we've missed the initiative to move into the digital age.
Today, we want to create our own e-commerce solution to reach an international clientele, but also more deeply the one we already have locally.
The final deliverable required is a mobile-first e-commerce site as well as an Android and/or iOS mobile application mirroring the mobile web version, and a web backoffice to manage content, all with a secure payment system that can be maintained over time.
